# DataStucturesImplementation
This repository includes the implementation of the vector, stack, queue, and BST data structures. 

Vector
A dynamic array that can grow or shrink as needed while the program is running.
Allows you to store a collection of items in a single entity, where each item can be accessed by an index.
Average-case time complexity of O(1) for accessing and inserting elements at the end of the vector, and O(n) for inserting or deleting elements at the beginning or middle of the vector.
Space complexity of O(n).

Stack
A linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
Useful for storing temporary data or reversing the order of items.
Average-case time complexity of O(1) for push and pop operations.
Space complexity of O(n).

Queue
A linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
Useful for storing items temporarily while waiting to process them, or maintaining the order in which items are added.
Average-case time complexity of O(1) for enqueue and dequeue operations.
Space complexity of O(n).

Linked List
A linear data structure consisting of a set of nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list.
Useful for storing a large number of items and inserting or deleting items frequently.
Average-case time complexity of O(1) for inserting and deleting elements at the beginning or end of the list, and O(n) for accessing or inserting/deleting elements in the middle of the list.
Space complexity of O(n).

Binary Search Tree (BST)
A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children and the values in the left subtree of a node are less than the value of the node, and the values in the right subtree are greater than the value of the node.
Useful for storing and searching for data efficiently in terms of time and space.
Average-case time complexity of O(log n) for searching, inserting, and deleting elements. Worst-case time complexity of O(n).
Space complexity of O(n).
